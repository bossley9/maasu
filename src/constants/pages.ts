MAASUx is a regional event, coordinated in collaboration with a campus host organization, designed to create additional opportunities to engage the midwest APIDA student community. MAASUx is a free event designed to attract college students from surrounding campuses to participate in educational workshops and fun activities. Through the more intimate setting of MAASUx programs, students can engage in creating high-quality connections with their peers and have the opportunity to reflect on their intersecting identities and experiences. These events are normally attended by 50-100 students.

MAASUx was initially launched in 2010 as MAASU Mixers before changing its name in summer 2016. Each MAASUx event began having a programming theme in 2017.

export const HOST_INFO_1 = `
Every fall, MAASU hosts a Leadership Summit, catered to 150-200 students, and every spring, MAASU hosts a Spring Conference, accommodating over 700 attendees. Each conference brings to light the history, challenges, and initiatives that the Asian Pacific Islander Desi American community faces. Each year, these conferences are hosted at different schools, allowing for the students around the Midwest to travel, explore, and gain a further understanding of the resources that their peers have. In addition, each host school showcases the talent of its students and local community through performances, workshops, and keynotes. Each conference closes with a banquet, and the Spring Conference also recognizes particular members in the community.
