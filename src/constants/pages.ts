export const PURPOSE_STMT_1 = `
The Midwest Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Students Union
(MAASU) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that began in response
to a need for political unity among Asian American students in the
Midwest. By 1990, there were more than 20 universities in the
Midwest that had formed Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA)
organizations. Some had been around for years, while others were
still in their infancy.
`

export const PURPOSE_STMT_2 = `
Students felt a need for an organization that would support the
growth of their groups and organize Midwestern Asian American
students for political activism. MAASU works to recognize the needs
of the Asian American community by assisting schools with the
establishment of Asian American student organizations, promoting
leadership among students, addressing educational needs and rights
of the Asian American community, and developing a channel of
communication among Asian American student organizations across the
Midwest.
